| PREREQUISITES

|   BEFORE ANYTHING ON THE LEFT THERE SHOULD BE A FILE NAMED "YARN.LOCK". DELETE IT.
|   AFTER IT HAS BEEN DELETED/REMOVED RUN THE COMMAND W/O THE QUOTES: "npm install"
|
| INSTRUCTIONS
|
| You should and can make the terminal window bigger by clicking and dragging the top line of the terminal window up. Enough to see
| to see everything.
|
| On the terminal to allow your computer to run shell scripts copy and paste this without the quotes ("): "chmod +x ./launch.sh"
| After entered press enter and should look like it added a new line. This is good, means its done.
|
| Afterwards enter the following to start the bot, again minus the ("): "npm run launch"
|
| If everything went as planned you should be seeing a welcome screen followed by a set of questions and instructions for the task.
| As of now you can only run environment at a time. If you would like more open another terminal by selecting the split terminal
| icon looks like [|] to the left of the ðŸ—‘ icon
|
| Best of luck !
